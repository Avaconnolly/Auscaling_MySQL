# Auscaling_MySQL
Autoscaling a MySQL database to meet fluctuating app demands using AWS Aurora
About: Aurora is compatible with both MySQL and PostgreSQL relational databases. It combines the performance and accessibility of traditional databses, but is simplier and more cost effective.
Automatic scaling is important to improve performance. This will also be able to remove and add read replicas.
